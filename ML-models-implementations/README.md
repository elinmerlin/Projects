# Regression ML models from scratch

The main goal of this work is to implement machine learning models from scratch in order to deeply understand the algorithms. That is why I tried not to use any library methods and not pay much attention to the final score, as long as the scores of the self-made models are similar to the scores of the sklearn models with the same hyperparameters.

As a dataset, I used Boston house prices dataset that comes with the scikit-learn library. The main idea is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.
