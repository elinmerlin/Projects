# Classification Decision tree and Random forest ML models from scratch

The main goal of this work is to implement machine learning models from scratch in order to deeply understand the algorithms. That is why I tried not to use any library methods and not pay much attention to the final score, as long as the scores of the self-made models are similar to the scores of the sklearn models with the same hyperparameters.

As a dataset, I used Breast cancer dataset that comes with the scikit-learn library. The main idea is to predict if the tumor is malignant ot benign.
